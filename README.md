## Project Overview

An Excel workbook that provides live stock data of Top 20 companies by market capitalization and a sample portfolio tracking stock buy prices and current prices with a one-month price comparison of two selected stocks. 

Real-time stock data was imported into excel to display the updated information. A sample portfolio was created where the buy prices and current prices were listed to calculate the gains or losses dynamically with conditional formatting applied to highlight the key movements and gains/losses. Two stocks were selected for a detailed comparison where their historical data over the past month was retrieved and visualized in a line chart to determine the price trends and portfolio performance.
